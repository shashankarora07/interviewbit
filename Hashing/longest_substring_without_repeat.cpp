/* Given a string, 

find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example:

The longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3.

For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.
*/

/*
Hint: 

Think in terms of two pointers. If you encounter a repeating character,
you wonâ€™t be able to include the new character till you exclude out the
previous occurrence of the character. Which means your window needs to shrink
till your start character is pointing to the position next to previous
occurrence of the character.

/* 
Explanation of code:

This solution uses extra space to store the last indexes of already visited
characters. The idea is to scan the string from left to right, keep track of
the maximum length Non-Repeating Character Substring seen so far in res. When
we traverse the string, to know the length of current window we need two
indexes. 1) Ending index ( j ) : We consider current index as ending index.
2) Starting index ( i ) : It is same as previous window if current character
was not present in the previous window. To check if the current character was
present in the previous window or not, we store last index of every character
in an array lasIndex[]. If lastIndex[str[j]] + 1 is more than previous start,
then we updated the start index i. Else we keep same i.

Time Complexity: O(n + d) where n is length of the input string and d is number
 of characters in input string alphabet. For example, if string consists of 
 lowercase English characters then value of d is 26.
Auxiliary Space: O(d)
